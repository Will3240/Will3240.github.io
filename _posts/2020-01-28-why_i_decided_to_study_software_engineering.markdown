I am new to software engineering so choose it because of that and because I have a background in IT in my teenage years at school and at College. I want to try something challenging and I have been interested in coding in the past during the IT courses. But I wasn't very good at it until I found Flatiron school. The course contains what I wanted to learn in the IT courses, they didn't cover as much code as FlatIron. I plan to get a job in software engineering to plan on not getting stuck in life. Coding I hear that it's interesting because not only is it a high paying job but not an easy subject to learn. I want to learn a new language so I chose Flatiron school. It's interesting how codes work to make different outputs when entering coding language.
